# Protein Condensate Atlas

Code and models associated with the manuscrupt "Protein Condensate Atlas from predictive models of heteromolecular condensate composition".

The code enables to prepare the relevant datasets, perform comparisons between them as outlined in the manuscript, train the models and finally, predict as well as validate the Protein Condensate Atlas.
